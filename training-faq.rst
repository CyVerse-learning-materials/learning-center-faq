Training FAQs

*How can I use CyVerse to teach my students?*
===============================================

You can use CyVerse’s Visual Interactive Computing Environment (VICE) to provide students with a controlled environment in which they can install tools, run analyses, or visual results in a consistent environment. 

  # Have your students sign up for CyVerse accounts.
  # In the CyVerse User Portal, navigate to the Requests section and complete the “Atmosphere: Reserving Cloud for Education”. If you do not have the CyVerse account information for all of your students when you complete the form, provide your user name and email to answer those questions. 
  # You will be notified when your class is set up. Note that we cannot provide access to your class ahead of time until we receive the student usernames and emails.
