**General FAQ Other CyVerse Services**
========================================

*What apps and workflows are in CyVerse?*
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
CyVerse has numerous apps and workflows in the Discovery Environment (DE).
For the list of applications available in the DE, see the |List of Applications|.
Most apps in the DE have user manuals to give you a jump-start on using the app.
You also can view the list of tutorials for helping you learn a complicated
workflow or how to use an app in the DE or Atmosphere.

----

*I need help using CyVerse's tools and resources from within my program*
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

See the information about our |Science APIs| and, if necessary, contact Support
using the blue Intercom icon |Intercom| at the bottom right of the platform.
You also can request community support or an external collaborative partnership,
or contact Support (support@cyverse.org).

----


*I need to make my app available for other people to use*
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
You can create a new app interface in the Discovery Environment and share it
with other users, you also can install the app on VICE or on a VM in the
Atmosphere cloud. In most cases, providing a Docker container (or a link
to one) with the application of your choice is all you need to start. See the
Developer's section of the |CyVerse Learning Center|.

----

*Is CyVerse infrastructure open access/open source?*
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Yes, some of CyVerse is open access. Anyone can retrieve publicly available
datasets. However, you must register for an account to upload data and run
analyses. All CyVerse code is open source and can be found on |CyVerse GitHub|.

----

*I need a letter of support for my grant proposal that uses CyVerse*
```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

To request a letter of support, email 411@cyverse.org describing the CyVerse
resources you need (e.g., storage, computing power, expertise for scaling, etc.)
and if any resulting datasets will be made publicly available.

----


*How do I apply for an external collaborative partnership?*
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

External Collaborative Partnerships (ECP) pair members of the CyVerse user
community with expert staff members to address the computational needs of a
scientific project. Requests are reviewed on an ongoing basis.

The criteria by which ECPs are reviewed are available here: |ECP criteria|.

To help you prepare for the |ECP application|, the questions on the form are
listed below.

**External Collaborative Partnership Questions**

			- Project Principal Investigator (PI)
			- Institution
			- Collaborating Personnel

				- Provide a detailed list of students, technicians, infromaticians and/or
				  developers who will be able to assist with project design and
				  implementation, their respective computational science skill sets
				  (e.g., web design, Python, GWAS, etc.), and their specific time
				  commitments during the project (e.g., 1.5 hrs/day).
			- Previous Interactions with CyVerse
			- Funding sources
			- Project title
			- Project description
			- Please summarize your proposal’s activities and desired outcomes (500 chars or less)
			- Scientific description

				- Provide a scientific description of your project. Describe how the
				  proposed project is within the scope of CyVerse’s scientific Enablement
				  Vision. Illustrate how any resulting deliverables have the potential to
				  enable science for scientists beyond your immediate network of
				  collaborators.

			- Technical Description

				- Provide a technical description of your project. What is the computational
				  need that is to be addressed with assistance from CyVerse? Identify
				  specific potential deliverables to be implemented using CyVerse
				  technologies, such as the Discovery Environment, Atmosphere, APIs, or
				  Data Store.
			- Timeline and Milestones for Completing the Project

				- provide a timeline of specific monthly milestones (deliverables). Projects
				  of short duration (~2 months) should provide weekly milestones.


			- Scientific and Technical Impact

				- Describe how the success of this collaboration will benefit your project
				  and the broader community.

			- Communication and Sharing Plan

				- Will you be making the data and/or workflows publicly available through CyVerse?
				- Blogging and/or tweeting about the work?
				- Presenting at institution or professional conference?
				- Will you be giving a talk about your work at your institution or at a professional conference?
				- Writing a news article for the CyVerse website?
				- Will you be preparing a tutorial that uses the datasets or workflows?
				- Will you be leading a workshop(s) or webinar(s) to teach others to use the data or workflow(s)?
				- Do you have any other communication plans?

*I want to use CyVerse in my course*
```````````````````````````````````````
DNA Subway (See |DNA Subway Guide|) is especially useful for teaching about gene
concepts, phylogenetics, DNA barcoding and RNA-Seq.

Atmosphere (See |Atmosphere Guide|)is a good platform for putting together the
software tools necessary to teach an informatics course or segment of a course.

----

*I would like a CyVerse workshop at my institution*
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````
CyVerse has limited funding to support workshop requests. We are especially
interested in training at underserved institutions (rural, HBCU/Tribal/Hispanic-serving, etc.).
Contact Education, Outreach, and Training Lead Jason Williams (williams@cshl.edu)
