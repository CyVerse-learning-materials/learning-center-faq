*How do I update my account information?*
========================================================

CyVerse users should update their account information annually for continued access to services. To update, go to the |user.cyverse.org|, log in, and click the |account icon| in the upper right corner. 

In addition to updating your email, institution, occupation, preferences and other information that may have changed, please add your ORCID ID, a unique identifier which helps you receive credit for your work. Get an ORCID here| |https://orcid.org/register|.

By keeping your account information current, our funders can see the value of CyVerse to our community and we learn which of our services and platforms are most helpful to you.
