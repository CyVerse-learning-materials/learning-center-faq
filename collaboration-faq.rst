How can I get a letter of collaboration for my grant proposal that uses CyVerse?
###################################################################################

*To request a letter of collaboration, email informaticians@cyverse.org with the following information:*
- the CyVerse resources your project will use (e.g., storage, computing power, expertise for scaling, etc.) and indicate if any resulting datasets will be made publicly available in CyVerse
- the name of the PI, proposal title, funding agency, and date you need the letter
- if there is a template that must be used, please attach to your email
