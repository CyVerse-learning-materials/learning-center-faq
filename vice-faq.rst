**VICE FAQ**
*************************

*I previously used Atmosphere to run instances for analysis and plotting. Where can I do this work now?*
=================================================

CyVerse’s Visual Interactive Computing Environment (VICE) is the place to run analyses that you previously ran in Atmosphere.

- If you need Python, try `Jupyter Lab SciPy Notebook Latest <https://sonora.cyverse.org/apps/de/bc93504c-d584-11e9-8413-008cfa5ae621/launch>`_
- If you need JupyterLab, try `Jupyter Lab SciPy Notebook Latest <https://sonora.cyverse.org/apps/de/bc93504c-d584-11e9-8413-008cfa5ae621/launch>`_
- If you need Rstudio, try `rstudio-3.5.0 <https://sonora.cyverse.org/apps/de/af14e76b-83bf-4a8a-a475-9d686e1bb868/launch>`_

*How do I use VICE?*
=======================

The best place to start is by `reviewing our guide <https://learning.cyverse.org/projects/vice/en/latest/index.html>`_. There are specific sections on using `JupyterLab <https://learning.cyverse.org/projects/vice/en/latest/user_guide/quick-jupyter.html>`_, `RStudio <https://learning.cyverse.org/projects/vice/en/latest/user_guide/quick-rstudio.html>`_, and `Shiny <https://learning.cyverse.org/projects/vice/en/latest/user_guide/quick-rshiny.html>`_. To find VICE apps in the Discovery Environment, select “VICE” in the Filter drop-down menu. Upon your first attempt to use a VICE app, you may have to request access. Once your access to VICE is approved, you can even `share VICE apps with teams and collaborators <https://learning.cyverse.org/projects/vice/en/latest/user_guide/sharing.html>`_.

*How can I use CyVerse to teach my students?*
===============================================

You can use CyVerse’s Visual Interactive Computing Environment (VICE) to provide students with a controlled environment in which they can install tools, run analyses, or visualize results in a consistent environment.

# The process to set-up CyVerse resources for teaching takes approximately 3 days.
# Have your students sign up for CyVerse accounts (free) using their institutional email.
# Have them send you their CyVerse username.
# In the CyVerse User Portal, navigate to the Requests section on the side-bar and complete the “Atmosphere: Reserving Cloud for Education”. If you do not have the CyVerse account information for all of your students when you complete the form, you may use your user name and email to answer those questions.
# You will be notified when your class resources are set up. Note that we cannot provide access to your class ahead of time until we receive the students’ usernames and emails.
