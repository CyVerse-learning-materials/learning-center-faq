**Getting help using CyVerse**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CyVerse team is small, but dedicated to helping you get what you need done.
There are a number of ways to get help using CyVerse:

1. For most questions you can browse or search the |CyVerse Learning Center| or
|CyVerse Wiki|. We also have several helpful videos (including on popular
science workflows) on the CyVerse |YouTube Channel|.

2. If you can find the answer you are looking for there, many CyVerse platforms
feature chat-based support. Look for the Intercom icon: |Intercom|. If you
catch us outside of working hours (weekdays 9-5PM US Mountain Time Zone), we
will follow up via email.

3. While Intercom is our preferred support mechanism (it creates a ticket
we can easily track) you can also email support@cyverse.org.
